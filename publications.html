          <h2>1.NDVI: DETECTION OF VEGETATION CHANGE USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS-A STUDY ON BARISHAL CITY CORPORATION,
            BANGLADESH</h2>
          <h2>Abstract:</h2>
          <h4>This article presents a method of analyzing satellite images to detect the change in the Land Cover
            pattern of the city corporation of Barisal, Bangladesh, from 2002 to 2020 using the Normalized Difference
            Vegetation Index (NDVI). The use of the Multi-Spectral Remotely Sensed data approach is widely known to find
            the extent & to detect the change in Land Cover of an area of interest. NDVI, which uses specific band
            combinations of remotely-sensed satellite data, assists in classifying Land Cover to detect the changes in
            land resources over time. Remote Sensed Data from Landsat TM & Sentinel-2 images have been used to perform
            the analysis. Different NDVI threshold values as required for classifying the Water bodies, Built-up areas,
            Sparse Vegetation & Dense Vegetation, are found by analyzing pixel by pixel analysis of the respective
            classes. NDVI map was prepared for the corresponding years; the highest and lowest of the pixel values for
            the individual class was found by analyzing the pixel value of that class. NDVI is highly useful in finding
            different surface characteristics of the visible area, which is helpful for policymakers to make decisions.
            The Vegetation index helps find the changes in vegetation cover and allows the respective authority to
            decide on environmental reservation and mitigation approaches. The empirical study finds a 32% decrease in
            the Dense Vegetation from 2002 to 2020 in Barisal, Bangladesh, followed by a 40% increase in the Built-up
            area throughout the concerned 18 years. Alongside that, Sparse Vegetation followed a rise of 130% from 2002
            to 2020. Thus, the extent of significant water bodies remained unchanged from 2002 to 2020. The NDVI values
            for the selected pixels of the respective classes were compared with the ground absolute values for accuracy
            analysis. Accuracy analysis finds an overall 92.86% accuracy of the classification.</h4>

          <h2>2.Geospatial Spreading of COVID-19 Cases Over Time and Relation with PM2.5 and Meteorological Parameters
            in Dhaka City</h2>
          <h2>Abstract:</h2>
          <h4>Air pollution in Dhaka is a buzzword in recent times. Dhaka becomes the headlines of news frequently due
            to its massively deteriorated air quality. Air pollution is a potential threat to city dwellers, and every
            year, many people die of respiratory diseases. The increasing amount of personal vehicles, unfit public
            transport, and some ongoing mega construction work significantly raise the air's particulate matter. The
            particulate matter can act as a virus carrier. It can easily be deposited to the lung's alveolar zones and
            affect the lung with the deadly Corona Virus. The study tried to find the correlation between particulate
            matter and covid-19 virus infection in Dhaka city from 15 April to 15 June. We did a correlation with
            particulate matter, and covid-19 daily reported cases. We tried to find the co-relation among particulate
            matter and other meteorological parameters (Temperature, humidity, and precipitation) to better understand
            the situation. We found a significant correlation among daily reported Covid-19 cases, temperature,
            humidity, and precipitation. We observed a decreasing pattern of daily cases with temperature precipitation
            and an increasing pattern with humidity. High precipitation and humidity decrease particulate matter in the
            air causing less transmission of viruses. Our study didn't find any direct relation of PM 2.5 with daily
            cases of Covid-19. As it was the onset of summer due to high humidity, the particle concentration remains
            low compared to the winter season. That is why in Dhaka city, the Covid-19 virus's slow transmission was
            observed in the initial phase.</h4>
